      <h2>LEGO</h2>
      <p>
        Today Lego is the world’s largest and most profitable toymaker. The Lego
        brick was named “Toy of the Century” in 1999, and in 2014 Time magazine
        crowned it the “Most Influential Toy of All Time,” ahead of Barbie, G.I.
        Joe, and the Easy Bake Oven.

        The enthusiasm and buying power of Adult Fans of Lego—or AFOLs, as
        they’re known in the industry—played a major role in the company’s rise
        to the top. But insiders say the road from “kids only” to “adults
        welcome” was a long, uphill climb.

      <h2>For Adults</h2>
      <p>
        “Before the late 1990s, the company didn’t think their adult fans had
        value,” says Smith-Meyer, who held a variety of senior posts at Lego
        from 2000 to 2014. “Leadership actually thought [adults] were detracting
        from the brand.” “Before the late 1990s, the company didn’t think their

        Thanks to a handful of employees who worked to change attitudes inside
        the company, Lego is no longer embarrassed by its adult fans. Gone are
        the days when labels on Lego boxes stated that the contents were
        appropriate only for boys ages 7 to 12. The bygone slogans "Just
        Imagine..." and "Play On" have been eclipsed by Lego's newest marketing
        motto: "Adults Welcome." Even superstar athletes and entertainers like
        Ed Sheeran, Dwight Howard, and David Beckham boast openly about their
        affinity for Lego building sets.

        It’s not every day that you get to create your own official LEGO® set.
        But for 25-year-old PhD student Truman Cheng, this dream has now become
        a reality. His idea received over 10,000 votes on the LEGO Ideas
        platform, and now it’s been turned into a real-life set. We give you...
        *drumroll*... the LEGO Ideas set Vincent van Gogh – The Starry Night.
